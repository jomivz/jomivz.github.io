# What is this?

This is publicly accessible personal mindmaps and notes at [https://jmvwork.xyz](https://jmvwork.xyz) about my IT experiments in networking and system administration, forensics and pentesting.

Using markdown as notes allows to fetch commands (using ```grep``` plus keywords) in order to be the more efficient in several situations, like when maintaining, auditing, investigating, passing exam or participating to a CTF.

{% hint style="warning" %}
* Do not take everything or anything in these notes for **granted** 
* Do not expect the notes to be exhaustive or covering the techniques or the artifacts they produce in full
* Expect mistakes in the notes
* Always consult additional resources
{% endhint %}

It is propulsed by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) allowing to build a website based on markdown files.
Sources files are available at the repository [https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io). 

Most of my notes are discovered by other security researchers and I do not claim their ownership. I try to reference the sources I use the best I can, but if you think I've missed something, please get in touch and I will fix it immediately.
