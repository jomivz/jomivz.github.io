##  <a name='Whatsthiswebsitescontentabout'></a>What's this website's content about?


> **This website is my selfish IT notebook** containing [cheatsheets](/cheatsheets) and [mindmaps](/mindmaps) (old ones for now).
There is mostly raw commands / without explanations. For all IT operational people, using markdowns is a common methodology. 

> There is no room here to challenge [hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz) nor [other awesome repositories](/#AwesomeRessources).
I recommend you to [refer to it first](/#AwesomeRessources) and **do not take my notes for granted**.


##  <a name='WhyhavingaproperITnotebook'></a> Why having a proper IT notebook? 

* If we are **mates**, there is a chance I share you my **HOWTO** through **jmvwork.xyz**.
On your appreciation, feel free to pull requests through the github repository [jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io).

* As **Cybersecurity Recruiter / Talent Acquisition**, my cheatsheets will let you appreciate my technical skills.

* For O/B/B (BFS) reasons: Ordering stuffs / Building my own methodology (tables of content, variables) / Being BETTER, FASTER, STRONGER (BFS).

* This website is propulsed by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), empowering jekyll to convert the markdowns into HTML.
