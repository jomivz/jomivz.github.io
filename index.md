# What is this?

This is publicly accessible personal mindmaps and notes at [www.jmvwork.xyz](https://jmvwork.xyz) about my IT experiments in networking and system administration, forensics and pentesting.

Using markdown as notes allows to fetch commands (using ```grep``` plus keywords) in order to be the more efficient in several situations... 
Like administrating, deploying, maintaining, auditing, investigating, passing exam or participating to a CTF.

* Do not take everything or anything in these notes for **granted** 
* Do not expect the notes to be exhaustive or covering the techniques or the artifacts they produce in full
* Expect mistakes in the notes
* Always consult additional resources

My notes will cover my training roadmap :
* CRTP (Certified Red Team Professional) by [pentesteracademy.com](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/activedirectorylab)
	* Good start to know Windows/Active Directory TTPs
* DFIR free training at [dfirdiva.com](https://freetraining.dfirdiva.com)
	* Referencement of DFIR sources (Youtube & Co) 
* [https://cyberdefenders.org/](https://cyberdefenders.org/)
* [tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com)
	* Good start to practice cybersecurity classic topics
* [letsdefend.io](https://letsdefend.io)
	* Not tried yet - stay tuned
* [chiheb-chebbi.com](https://www.chiheb-chebbi.com)
	* Not tried yet - stay tuned
* OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional) by [offensive-security.com](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/)
	* The best certification to start infrastructure security audit as a professional
* CCNP Routing & Switching (Cisco Certified Network Professional) - passed in 2014 - by Cisco
	* Certification on the path to become an expert. Gaps are huge between the CCNA, the CCNP and the CCIE. Cheatsheets might be not updated.  
* Encase Certified Examinor - writing passed 2016 - by Guidance / Opentext
	* Definitely not an EDR, but a leader on the market to investigate Windows OS, NTFS and blob

This website is inspired by more advance projects I recommend you to have a look :
* [ired.team repository](https://ired.team): common offensive security techniques
* [Project wadcoms](https://wadcoms.github.io): Windows/AD offensive security techniques
* [Project LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io): Windows LOLBAS offensive security techniques used for download, execute and bypass 
* [Project GTFO](https://gtfobins.github.io): Linux GTFO offensive security techniques used for download, execute and bypass

It is propulsed by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) allowing to build a website based on markdown files.
Sources files are available at the repository: [github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io). 

Most of my notes are discovered by other security researchers and I do not claim their ownership. 
I try to reference the sources I use the best I can, but if you think I've missed something, please get in touch and I will fix it immediately.
