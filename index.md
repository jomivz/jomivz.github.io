# What is this?

This is publicly accessible personal mindmaps and notes at [https://jmvwork.xyz](https://jmvwork.xyz) about my IT experiments in networking and system administration, forensics and pentesting.

Using markdown as notes allows to fetch commands (using ```grep``` plus keywords) in order to be the more efficient in several situations, like when maintaining, auditing, investigating, passing exam or participating to a CTF.

* Do not take everything or anything in these notes for **granted** 
* Do not expect the notes to be exhaustive or covering the techniques or the artifacts they produce in full
* Expect mistakes in the notes
* Always consult additional resources

My notes will cover my training roadmap :

This website is inspired by more advance projects I recommend you to have a look :
* [ired.team repository](https://ired.team): common offensive security techniques
* [project wadcoms](https://wadcoms.github.io): Windows/AD offensive security techniques
* [project lolbas](https://lolbas-project.github.io): Windows LOLBAS offensive security techniques used for download, execute and bypass 
* [project](https://gtfobins.github.io): Linux GTFO offensive security techniques used for download, execute and bypass

It is propulsed by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) allowing to build a website based on markdown files.
Sources files are available at the repository [https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io). 

Most of my notes are discovered by other security researchers and I do not claim their ownership. I try to reference the sources I use the best I can, but if you think I've missed something, please get in touch and I will fix it immediately.
