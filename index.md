##  <a name='Whatisthis'></a>What is this?


**This website is my selfish IT notebook** containing [cheatsheets](/cheatsheets) and [mindmaps](/mindmaps).
There is mostly raw commands / without explanations. For all IT operational people, using markdowns is a common methodology. 

There is no room here to challenge [hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz) nor [equivalent repositories](#equivalentrepositories).
I recommend you to [refer to it first](#equivalentrepositories) and **DO NOT TAKE MY NOTES FOR GRANTED**.

**If we are mates**, there is a chance I share you my **HOWTO** howto through **jmvwork.xyz**.
On your appreciation, feel free to pull requests through the github repository [jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io).


##  <a name='FAQ'></a>FAQ


* **Why having a proper IT notebook?** 
There are 2 reasons: this website allows me to share the topics I practiced / what I can do;
ordering stuffs / building my own methodology (tables of content, variables) / being **BETTER, FASTER, STRONGER**.

* How can we **get in contact?**. 
You are welcome to visit the [about](/about/) page where you can find my contact.

##  <a name='Copyleft'></a>Copyleft


* Sources files are available at the github repository [jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io). 
* It relies on the [sortable javascript project](https://githubhelp.com/tofsjonas/sortable) to sort the cheatsheets
* This website is propulsed by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), empowering jekyll to convert the markdowns into HTML.
* There is no copyright. Most of the content is aggregation of online sources.
