# What is this?

This is publicly accessible personal **mindmaps** and **notes** at [www.jmvwork.xyz](https://jmvwork.xyz)
 - about my IT experiments in networking and system administration, forensics and pentesting.

Using markdown as notes allows to fetch commands (using ```grep``` plus keywords) in order to **be the more efficient in several situations**... 
Like administrating, deploying, maintaining, auditing, investigating, passing exam or participating to a CTF.

> * DO NOT take everything or anything in these notes for granted 
> * DO NOT expect the notes to be exhaustive
> * Expect mistakes in the notes
> * Always consult additional resources

> * [Project wadcoms](https://wadcoms.github.io): Windows/AD offensive security techniques.
> * [Project LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io): Windows LOLBAS offensive security techniques used for download, execute and bypass. 
> * [Project GTFO](https://gtfobins.github.io): Linux GTFO offensive security techniques used for download, execute and bypass.
> * [Project Windows Processes & Events](https://winprocs.dfir.tips): Last but not least, crucial informations regarding how Windows OS works and traces.

It is propulsed by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) allowing to build a website based on markdown files.
Sources files are available at the repository: [github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io). 

Most of my notes are discovered by other security researchers and I do not claim their ownership. 
I try to reference the sources I use the best I can, but if you think I've missed something, please get in touch and I will fix it immediately.
