# What is this?

This is publicly accessible personal [cheatsheets](/cheatsheets) and [mindmaps](/mindmaps) available at [jmvwork.xyz](/),
> - about IT experiments in networking and system administration, forensics and pentesting.
> - Most of my notes are discovered by other security researchers and I do not claim their ownership.

**DO IT, BETTER, FASTER, STRONGER**

Using markdowns as notes allows to fetch commands (using ```grep``` plus keywords) in order to be the more efficient in several situations, like when maintaining, auditing, investigating, passing exam or participating to a CTF.

> * DO NOT take everything or anything in these notes for **granted** 
> * DO NOT expect the notes to be exhaustive
> * Expect mistakes in the notes
> * Always consult additional resources

Equivalent repositories that I grep before making a cheatsheet: 
> * [thehacker.recipes](https://thehacker.recipes)
> * [hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz)
> * [ired.team](https://ired.team) 
> * [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings)

# Can I do the same? Can I improve it?

> * Sources files are available at the github repository [jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io). 
> * It relies on the [sortable javascript project](https://githubhelp.com/tofsjonas/sortable) to sort the cheatsheets
> * This website is propulsed by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), empowering jekyll to convert the markdowns into HTML.
> * I try to reference the sources I use the best I can, but if you think I've missed something, please get in touch and I will fix it immediately.
> * On your appreciation, feel free to pull requests.
