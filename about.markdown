# About

About me and this website, my name Jonathan aka **jomivz**. I am a cybersecurity consultant. **This website is my selfish IT notebook.**
There is no room here to challenge [hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz).

**If we are mates**, there is a chance I share you few **HOWTOs** via my cheatsheets(/).
Of course, you can send me a pull request through the github repository [jomivz.github.io](https://github.com/jomivz/jomivz.github.io).

Below a personal reminder of PR 101 I work on.
![PR 101](/assets/images/about-gh-pull-request.jpg)

First thing first, please visit and read of my [homepage](/) :)

Otherwise you can reach me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmichelvillaz/).

Thanks you for reading! I wish you a nice journey.

**Regards**
**Jomivz**
